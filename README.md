# audible-util

**audible-util** is a command-line utility for converting Audible `.aaxc` audiobook files into standard audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC) using a voucher file generated by [audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli). It leverages `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for decoding and metadata extraction, providing a robust and extensible tool for audiobook enthusiasts and archivists.

---

## Features

- Converts Audible `.aaxc` files to MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, or M4A.
- Uses voucher files from `audible-cli` for decryption.
- Automatically infers voucher file if not specified.
- **Chapter splitting** - Split audiobooks into individual chapter files.
- **Hierarchical chapter organization** - Organize chapters into folders based on book structure.
- **Smart chapter merging** - Merge short chapters to prevent audio gaps.
- **Flexible naming formats** - Customize how chapter files are named.
- **Duration filtering** - Filter out chapters below a minimum duration.
- Extensible output format system (easy to add new formats).
- Progress indication and detailed logging.
- Helpful error messages and validation.
- **Short CLI options** - Use `-s`, `-v`, `-o`, etc. for faster command entry.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (edition 2021 or later): [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**: Must be installed and available in your `PATH`.
  - The tool checks for these dependencies before any processing and will provide a clear error if they are missing.
  - On Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    ```
  - On macOS (Homebrew):
    ```sh
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
  - On Windows:
    Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to your `PATH`.

### Build from Source

Clone the repository and build with Cargo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audible-util.git
cd audible-util
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in `target/release/audible-util`.

---

## Usage

All user-provided arguments and files are validated before any processing begins. The tool will check:
- That the input `.aaxc` file exists, is readable, and has the correct extension.
- That the voucher file exists and is readable (if provided or inferred).
- That the output directory exists and is writable (if a custom output path is provided).
- That `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are installed and available in your `PATH`.

If any of these checks fail, you will receive a clear, actionable error message.

### Basic Command

```sh
audible-util -a /path/to/book.aaxc -v /path/to/book.voucher
```

If `-v` is omitted, the tool will look for a voucher file named `<book>.voucher` in the same directory as the `.aaxc` file.

### CLI Options

| `--min-chapter-duration`    | `-d`  | Seconds      | No       | Minimum chapter duration in seconds. Default: 0 (no minimum).              |
| `--chapter-naming-format`   | `-f`  | Format       | No       | Chapter naming format. Default: `chapter-number-title`.                     |
| `--split-structure`         | `-t`  | Structure    | No       | Output structure: `flat` or `hierarchical`. Default: `flat`.                |
| `--merge-short-chapters`    | `-m`  | Flag         | No       | Merge short chapters with next chapter instead of filtering them out.       |
| `--output-type`             | `-T`  | Format       | No       | Output file type. Default: `mp3`. Supports: mp3, wav, flac, ogg, m4a.      |

#### Example: Convert to FLAC with custom output path

```sh
audible-util -a book.aaxc -v book.voucher -T flac -o mybook.flac
```

#### Example: Use default voucher and output

```sh
audible-util -a book.aaxc
```

#### Example: Split into chapters with hierarchical structure

```sh
audible-util -a book.aaxc -v book.voucher -s -t hierarchical -o chapters/
```

#### Example: Split with short chapter merging and custom naming

```sh
audible-util -a book.aaxc -v book.voucher -s -d 10 -m -f number-title -o chapters/
```

#### Example: Full featured command

```sh
audible-util -a book.aaxc -v book.voucher -s -d 5 -f chapter-number-title -t hierarchical -m -T flac -o output_dir/
```

## Voucher File Requirements

- The voucher file must be a JSON file generated by [audible-cli](https://github.com/audible-tools/audible-cli).
- The file is validated for required fields and structure.
- If invalid or missing, the tool will display a detailed error message.

---

## Output Formats

- **MP3** (default): `-T mp3`
- **WAV**: `-T wav`
- **FLAC**: `-T flac`
- **OGG**: `-T ogg`
- **M4A**: `-T m4a`

The output format system is extensible. To add a new format, implement the `OutputFormat` trait in [`src/cli.rs`](src/cli.rs:30).

## Chapter Splitting

The tool can split audiobooks into individual chapter files using chapter metadata from a `chapters.json` file.

### Chapter File Requirements

- The chapter file must be named `<book>-chapters.json` and placed in the same directory as the `.aaxc` file.
- The file must contain valid JSON with chapter timing information.
- The tool will automatically infer the chapter file path if not explicitly provided.

### Chapter Naming Formats

- **`chapter-number-title`** (default): `Chapter01_Title.mp3`
- **`number-title`**: `01_Title.mp3`
- **`title-only`**: `Title.mp3`

### Output Structures

- **`flat`** (default): All chapters in a single directory
- **`hierarchical`**: Organize chapters into folders based on book structure (e.g., `Part_One/Chapter01.mp3`)

### Chapter Processing Options

- **Minimum Duration**: Filter out chapters shorter than specified duration (`-d` seconds)
- **Merge Short Chapters**: Merge short chapters with the next chapter to prevent audio gaps (`-m`)
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically handles chapters with no content or very short durations

## Advanced Features

### Progress Tracking

The tool provides detailed progress information during conversion:
- Real-time ffmpeg progress for each chapter
- Chapter-by-chapter conversion status
- File counting and validation
- Detailed logging with `RUST_LOG=info`

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with clear, actionable messages:
- Input file validation (existence, readability, format)
- Voucher file validation and parsing
- Chapter file validation and parsing
- Output directory creation and permission checks
- External tool availability checks

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors

- **"Input file does not exist"**
  The path provided to `--aaxc-path` does not point to a file. Check the file path and try again.

- **"Input file does not have a .aaxc extension"**
  The input file must have a `.aaxc` extension.

- **"Input file is not readable"**
  Check file permissions for the input file.

- **"Voucher file does not exist" / "Voucher file is not readable"**
  Check the voucher file path and permissions.

- **"Output directory does not exist" / "Output directory is not writable"**
  Ensure the output directory exists and is writable, or specify a different output path.

- **"Required external tool 'ffmpeg'/'ffprobe' is not installed or not found in your PATH"**
  Install the missing tool and ensure it is available in your system `PATH`. See Prerequisites above.

- **"Could not get file stem from the input file path"**
  Ensure the `--aaxc-path` points to a valid `.aaxc` file.

- **"Failed to open voucher file"**
  Check that the voucher file exists and is readable.

- **"Failed to parse voucher file"**
  The voucher file must be valid JSON generated by `audible-cli`.

- **"Chapter file does not exist"**
  The tool requires a `chapters.json` file when using `-s`. Place it in the same directory as the `.aaxc` file.

- **"Failed to parse chapter file"**
  The chapter file must be valid JSON with proper chapter timing information.

- **"No chapters found after filtering"**
  All chapters were filtered out due to minimum duration requirements. Try reducing `-d` or using `-m` to merge short chapters.

- **"Failed to start ffmpeg/ffprobe"**
  Ensure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are installed and available in your `PATH`.

- **"ffmpeg/ffprobe failed with error"**
  The input file may be corrupt or not a valid Audible AAXC file.

- For verbose logs, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:
  ```sh
  RUST_LOG=info audible-util -a book.aaxc
  ```
